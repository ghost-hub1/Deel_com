  <meta name="description" content="Who we are is what we do.

Deel and our family of growing companies are made up of global teams dedicated to helping businesses hire anyone, anywhere, easily. 

The team comprises over three thousand self-driven individuals spanning over 100 countries, and our unified yet diverse culture keeps us continually learning and innovating the platform and products for customers.

Companies should be able to hire the best talent anywhere in the world, so we are building the best platform to make that a reality. Our market-leading technology, expertise, and global team are crucial to the platform’s success. We deliver the best products and features in our space, enabling millions of jobs worldwide and connecting the global workforce with the best companies and opportunities.

Why should you be part of our success story?

A 30-mile hiring radius should no longer dictate how companies hire because exceptional talent lives everywhere. Deel sees a world without hiring borders and endless talent that pairs perfect candidates with great companies.

We offer global teams all the tools they need to hire, onboard, manage, pay, and scale at full speed. We aim to foster a diverse global economy by building a generational platform that seamlessly connects companies with talent worldwide.

After our successful Series D in 2021, we raised another $50M in 2023, doubling our valuation to $12B. There’s never been a more exciting time to join Deel — the international payroll and compliance market leader.
