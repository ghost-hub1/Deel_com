          <span><h3>Career discussion with manager template overview</h3>
<p>A career discussion meeting template is a structured tool guiding one-on-one conversations between managers and their employees regarding career development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These discussions are crucial for understanding employees' aspirations, aligning their goals with organizational objectives, and planning for future growth within the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The template includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guidance for managers: </strong>Managers get detailed instructions on how to approach the discussion, emphasizing the importance of understanding the employee's career aspirations and aligning them with the organization's goals</li>
<li><strong>Structured meeting agenda for the first one-on-one meeting focused on career development: </strong>Managers get specific questions and directives on the objectives of each segment of the conversation, ensuring a productive and meaningful exchange—this guidance helps managers prepare and focus on the right topics to fully engage the employees in shaping their career path</li>
<li><strong>Fillable sections for meeting notes: </strong>The template has structured spaces allowing for real-time documentation of discussions, decisions, and action items for career growth—this feature ensures that the manager and their direct reports have a clear, mutual understanding of the discussion outcomes and agreed-upon next steps</li>
<li><strong>Career development action plan: </strong>The template outlines a detailed, actionable strategy for career development, including goal setting and defining milestones and timelines—this approach will help managers co-create a tailored action plan that outlines specific steps employees can take to achieve their career objectives</li>
<li><strong>Follow-up and check-ins: </strong>The template encourages establishing a schedule for regularly reviewing employee progress toward career goals—the check-in meetings will be instrumental in reviewing the action plan's progress, making necessary adjustments, and supporting the employee's development (managers can set their next meeting with the employees immediately)</li>
<li><strong>Section to document roadblocks: </strong>Managers can get an overview of the challenges and roadblocks encountered by the employees on their professional development journey—the employee can fill in the section before the next meeting</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to use this&nbsp;career discussion with manager template</h3>
<p>Using this template, managers can effectively conduct career discussions that not only motivate employees but also actively contribute to their professional growth and alignment with organizational goals. This structured approach ensures that career development is a continuous, supportive process that fosters employee engagement and retention.</p>
<p>Steps to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the employee’s previous performance evaluations, OKRs, and any past career development plans</li>
<li>Review the questions and discussion points included in the agenda template so that they are tailored to the employee’s career interests and aspirations. (For example, for a high-performing employee, you can add questions to investigate whether or not they are interested in a leadership role. In contrast, for a new employee, you can focus the development conversation on short-term goals until they feel fully settled into the company.)</li>

<li>Collaboratively develop an action plan with specific, achievable steps that support the employee’s career goals</li>

</ul>
